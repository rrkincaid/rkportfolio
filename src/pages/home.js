        Hi! My name is Rachel and I am a web developer located in Colorado. I
        began coding fairly recently but thanks to DU Coding Bootcamp and their
        amazing staff and my fellow students, I can now count myself as a full
        stack web developer. Please explore this page to see the projects I have
        been working on recently and to learn a little more about me. Follow the
        links above to navigate through the page. Pretty exciting stuff here!
