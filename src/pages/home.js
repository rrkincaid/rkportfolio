        Hi! My name is Rachel and I am a web developer located in Colorado. I
        began coding fairly recently but thanks to DU Bootcamp and their amazing
        staff and my fellow students, I can now count myself as a full stack web
        developer. I am building my portfolio currently and if you wish to see
        projects that I have worked on in the past, please follow the links
        above to explore those. Pretty exciting stuff here!
